- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Changing font styles, like font-size and line-height, can undo spacing work between sections. Matching fonts and text-spacing to a design first reduces repeat spacing efforts.

### Continued development

In the future, I'll look at best practices for organizing Sass, as well as css naming approaches, like BEM.
